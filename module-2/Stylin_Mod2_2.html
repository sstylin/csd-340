        <h2>Chapter Title: Introduction to Myself</h2>
        
        <p class="intro">I grew up in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. I come from a big family, nine brothers and one sister. My childhood was filled with adventures and explorations that shaped who I am today.</p>
        
        <p>I have a passion for technology and enjoy learning new programming languages. <span class="sentence">This fascination started when I was introduced to computers at a young age.</span> I often spend my weekends working on personal projects and enhancing my skills.</p>
        
        <p>Family is very important to me. I cherish the moments spent with my loved ones, whether it's a simple dinner or a family vacation. These experiences have taught me the value of togetherness and support.</p>
        
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy various hobbies such as reading, hiking, painting. Each of these activities allows me to express my creativity and connect with the world around me. They also provide a perfect balance to my academic pursuits.</p>
